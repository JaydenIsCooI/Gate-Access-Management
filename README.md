## How to Contribute
In order to contribute in a way that is easy for everyone to collaborate, follow these steps:
NOTE: You will be doing this for every set of changes made. Changes should be relevant to the branch you are working in. Many of these steps can be done within your chosen editor. I'm adding the commands because they are universal regardless of the editor chosen. DM me if you have questions about this.
1. In your local branch, commit the changes that you would like to push
	- Before you committing your changes, if you were working on main, you can create a local branch by running the following command in the terminal
		- `git checkout -b YOUR_NAME/YOUR_BRANCH_TITLE`
		- ex: `git checkout -b jordy/garage_ui_fixes`
2. Make sure to add your name at the end of your commit
	- ex: "Made changes to the garage ui and fixed the classes related to it - Jordy Benitez"
3. Commit your changes and push your local branch to origin
	- `git commit -m "Made changes to the garage ui and fixed the classes related to it - Jordy Benitez"`
	- `git push`
4. Either within the editor of your choice or within GitHub, create a pull request for your branch.
5. Get the approval of our QA Tester
6. Merge your changes into the "main" branch
